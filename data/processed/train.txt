The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application.\n\n\n\nRole & Responsibilities:\n\nâ To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries.\n\nâ To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on.\n\nâ Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing.\n\nâ Create workflow/batches and set the session dependencies.\n\nâ Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation.\n\nâ Developed Mapplet, reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse.\n\nâ Created Sessions & Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the Target Database.\n\nâ Involved in Unit Case Testing (UTC)\n\nâ Performing Unit Testing and UAT for SCD Type1/Type2, fact load and CDC implementation.\n\n\n\nPersonal Scan\n\n\n\nAddress: Jijayi Heights, Flat no 118, Narhe, (Police chowki) Pune- 411041
